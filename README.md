# UnivAI-AI-3-Project


### Problem Statement
**Teaching Assistant Bot**
Chatbots are one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing. For the scope of this project, we will focus on creating a user-friendly tool that helps the Teaching Staff automatically answer questions posed by students on a forum.

**The core problem we are trying to solve is to help answer questions that are frequently asked by students in a learning setup. We are not looking for a bot that is capable of answering extremely specific and one-of-a-kind questions. The idea is to reduce the load from the TAs but dealing with questions that are repetitive and whose response does not change in different scenarios.**

For this, you will first train a language model on The Stanford Question Answering Dataset. Fine-tune your model with the custom dataset we have collected from Univ.Ai's AI-1 course. Define and train a simple RNN network with 2 RNN layers as your baseline model. Using the knowledge learned during the duration of this, come up with an algorithm that outperforms the baseline and works in a real-time setting. The dataset is available on the scaffold.
